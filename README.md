# mobile-app
A mobile app to compare grocery prices at stores near you. Developed using HTML5, CSS and jquery mobile, this app currently displays the price comparison report for static data (fixed stores and items). In future I intend to implement geolocation and much more dynamic content where it lets the user input their current location and the grocery items whose prices they want to compare.
